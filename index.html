    <h1>DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD</h1>
    <h2 class="year">1996</h2>
    <h2 class="descrtitle">DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p class="description">Innocent young black man Ashtray is forced to move into a tough Los Angeles slum with his family, including his oddly streetwise, pot-smoking grandma. Before long, Ashtray's nuclear-armed gangster cousin Loc Dog introduces him to a bizarrely comic crime underworld. Luckily, Ashtray falls for urban poet Dashiki, and she convinces him to go straight â€“ but he must deal with her manic ex-boyfriend Toothpick.</p>

             Outrageous is the key word here. In many successful scenes, the Wayans deftly play on our assumptions and cliches.

             Perhaps if "Menace'' had been shorter and some of the weaker sketches had been left on the cutting-room floor, it would have added up to a stronger whole. In the end, it is too small a menace to match the efforts of filmmakers like Singleton and Lee.
